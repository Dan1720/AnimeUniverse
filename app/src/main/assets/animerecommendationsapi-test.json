      "content": "\"Shy girl makes friends\" is a common trope for a reason. Amidst other shows with complex plots with morally grey characters, sometimes what I want are simple stories with characters I can whole-heartedly cheer for. Sawako and Akane start as good-natured but lonely students who start opening up more after crossing paths with a popular, thoughtful guy who can appreciate them for who they really are. Both Sawako and Akanes' personal growth is easy to get invested in, and this is the main reason I enjoy both so much. Both male leads are likeable, respectable, but still believably flawed in one way or another. All the characters are intentionally ordinary and imperfect, which makes them believable and easy to sympathize with. Kimi ni Todoke definitely focuses on story/drama over comedy, but it has plenty of lighter moments that keep it from feeling draining. Jijou wo Shiranai Tenkousei ga Guigui Kuru still delivers touching, serious moments amidst the humor. Both are some of the only shows that have made me tear up at a purely-happy scene.",

This is the kinda vibe a relaxed and laid back SOL anime gives you. No romance, no action scenes, nothing supernatural, nothing sci-fi, nothing that makes you cringe, nothing that makes you get all hyped up. Just a simple story about a character going about their daily life, doing their hobbies, exploring places etc. This is exactly what these two anime have in common. SOL fan's are sure to enjoy this. As for the rest, it's up to the individual. Although chances are high that you may find both to be boring.",

The titular characters are cadets on a starship whose planet is conquered by its powerful neighbor and surrenders immediately. But rather than turn themselves in with their superiors, the crew gets funding from the galactic news network to carry on an insurgency campaign that becomes a popular reality TV show. But having combat live-streamed is not all fun and games when the enemy is watching too…",

Attack on Titan focuses on Eren Yeager, a determined youth who wants to free his people from oppression. Both Thorfinn and Eren undergo significant personal growth throughout their respective narratives, driven by their intense motivations and the challenges they face. Their complex character arcs allow readers to connect deeply with their struggles, ideals, and transformations. The depth and thematic complexity found in both stories are additional parallels. Vinland Saga delves into topics such as pacifism, honor, and the cyclical nature of violence. It explores the contrast between personal desires and societal expectations. Similarly, Attack on Titan explores themes of freedom, morality, and the blurred lines between heroes and villains. Both series pose thought-provoking questions about the nature of humanity, the complexities of war, and the search for purpose in a chaotic world. Overall, Vinland Saga and Attack on Titan share compelling similarities, such as: incredible dialogues, breathtaking moments, epic journeys, and profound character development.",

In both animes there is a warrior who is almost invincible in hand-to-hand combat (Guts and Schenkopp).",

      "content": "Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans and 86 shares some similarities in themes and storytelling. While they have distinct storylines and settings, a few aspects make them comparable. Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans is set in a future where children are used as soldiers known as \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" pilots. The story follows a group of young orphans who form a private military organization and strive for independence and equality. Similarly, 86 depicts a society divided between the privileged elite, known as the \"Handlers,\" and the marginalized group of soldiers known as the \"86.\" The story follows the experiences of the 86 as they fight for their humanity and dignity in a society that dehumanizes and discards them. Both anime explore the concept of discrimination and the consequences it has on individuals and society. They shed light on how prejudice and social inequality affect different groups of people and the struggles they face due to these biases. If you enjoy anime that delves into social issues, provide emotional depth, and combine action with meaningful storytelling, Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans and 86 are worth considering.",

But I will not use the same positive words for the battle scenes... In the battle scenes of the Naruto anime, the characters dominate the seriousness of the event and this atmosphere (except flashback) is preserved until the end of the war. But let's come to the Black Clover anime Characters can give irrelevant reactions in general. (Being stuck with something else on the verge of death, etc.) And this makes the anime childish and absurd... Also, the systems used in the two animes are different. In Naruto, techniques are done thanks to \"chakra\", while in Black Clover anime, everything is done with \"spell books\" in general. Still, I think the most important connection in these two anime is the personality of the characters. I recommend you to give it a try :)",

An unwilling MC turns out to be the target of an forced engagement driven by their manipulative mother figure, who seeks vengeance against the world? Is everyone obsessed with trying to capture or defeat the MC because they are a potential doomsday weapon that could change the world, even though they are objectively nobody without it? The MC is an invincible OP with emotional issues while their partner is tsundere oujo-sama who is supposed to lead her family? The MC looks at her like she's an aristocratic boss when they actually care deeply about each other? Is the MC really the one for whom all this was conceived? Is the show obsessed with rebels and terrorists attacking a school as part of a more general world war theme? Does the theme of racism and class intolerance play a big role in the relationship between the characters? Are they really different shows?",

Representatives of different industrial and political clans study at the school, who turn the school for political ambitions and clarifications, whose version of a specific weapon is better? Check. A technology race with allusions to corporatism and the Cold War? Check. Is the MC paired with another character, with whom they has an imbalance in power dynamics and an unspecified platonic or romantic relationship? Check. In the future, the show turns into a political action thriller, where everyone forgot about the lessons? Of course.",
